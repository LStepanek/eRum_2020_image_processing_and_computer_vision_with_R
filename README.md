# [eRum 2020] Image processing and computer vision with R

This is a repository for purposes of a workshop _Image processing and computer vision with R_ at [eRum 2020](https://2020.erum.io/).

<b>Abstract.</b> Image processing and computer vision as data-science domains can utilize tons of data since image data are one of the richest data types. Performing an image data analysis means a great possibility to employ smart algorithms such as deep learning, but it also requires a handy toolbox and sufficient computing power. Although R is sometimes not considered as a number-one language for image processing, there are options on how to effectively handle these tasks in the R environment. Furthermore, there is a large R speaking community that would like to combine image data analysis with other kinds of analyses, and they would welcome an option to keep all their code “under one roof” within R. In this workshop, using a hands-on approach, we will firstly revisit currently available packages such as magick, imager, EBImage (and some others), and their functionalities, which deal mainly with image processing and are written purely in R (and for R). A couple of time will be dedicated to amazing Bnosac’s family of R packages enabling computer vision and some other algorithmic tasks, e. g. objects or face detection and recognition. Finally, we would like to go a bit deeper into state-of-the-art possibilities and the bridging of the R environment to non-R-based libraries using API packages. For instance, a connection between R and C++ library dlib using R dlib package or using openCV library via ROpenCVLite R package.
