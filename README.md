# [eRum 2020] Image processing and computer vision with R

This is a repository for purposes of a workshop _Image processing and computer vision with R_ at [eRum 2020](https://2020.erum.io/).

<b>Abstract.</b> Although R is sometimes not considered as a number-one language for image processing, there are options for effectively handling these tasks in the R environment. Furthermore, a large R speaking community would like to combine image data analysis with other kinds of analyses by keeping all their code "under one roof" within R.

In this workshop, we will revisit available packages such as magick, imager, EBImage (and some others) written purely in R (and for R), which deal mainly with image processing. A couple of times will be dedicated to amazing Bnosacâ€™s family of R packages enabling computer vision and some other algorithmic tasks, besides other, objects or face detection and recognition. Finally, we will take a short look a bit deeper into state-of-the-art possibilities bridging the R environment to non-R-based libraries using API packages, namely ROpenCVLite or dlib R package.
